## 🧬 Prompt Evolution Process

### 🟢 Step 1 — Study Plan Initialization  
**Prompt:**  
“I have 14 days to prepare for DBMS, OS, CN, AI, and SE exams. Create a balanced study timetable.”

**Response (Excerpt):**  
- Days 1–10: Core learning (3 subjects × 2 hrs each)  
- Days 11–13: Revision blocks  
- Day 14: Mock test + recovery  

---

### 🔵 Step 2 — Difficulty-Based Optimization  
**Prompt:**  
“OS and AI are more difficult. Allocate extra hours for these subjects.”

**AI Adjustment:**  
- OS → 3 hours every alternate day  
- AI → 2.5 hours every third day  
- DBMS, CN, SE → 1.5 hours average  

---

### 🟣 Step 3 — Motivation & Health Integration  
**Prompt:**  
“Include wellness breaks and motivational tips in my daily plan.”

**AI Output:**  
**🧘 Wellness Schedule:**  
- 10:00 AM – Stretch & hydrate  
- 1:00 PM – Short meal break  
- 5:00 PM – Walk or relax  

**📣 Motivation Tips:**
